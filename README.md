  <h2>Bio</h2>
Hello, my name is Bernard, I’m 19 years old, and I am passionate about programming. I am currently heading into my 5th semester of college and work as a systems analyst intern at Grendene. I have experience with programming languages like Java and C, and I’m always seeking new technologies to learn and apply in my work and personal projects.
I started my programming journey about a year ago, and since then, I’ve been dedicated to improving my skills and expanding my technical knowledge. Technology has always been a big passion of mine, and I believe it has a transformative impact on the world. I’m currently looking for new job opportunities to continue growing professionally..
